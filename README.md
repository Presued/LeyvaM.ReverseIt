# LeyvaM.ReverseIt

it will reverse what ever the the user has input in the program
//Peer Review Chris Martinez, the program is intended to take a word and an integer, and reverse it. 
The question from the users input is a little confussing, because its asking for a word and a letter, of my choice but its not been specify in what order, or in what sequence, so this is confussing. If the programer can clean up the wording a little more, than the program will be simplify.
